# Client-Server-Comunicatio-with-substring
Checking if the strings are under message strings, if the string is genuine. It is written in c++ programming language
#STEPS
#1.Install g++ compiler in you linux machine 
#2.Put the files Client.cpp and Server.cpp on dekstop
#3.Open two terminals 
4.First Terpinal type This 
cd Desktop
g++ Server.cpp
./a.out 53455
5.In the other Terminal type this
cd Desktop
g++ Client.cpp
./a.out localhost 53455

this is the Requeriment for SERVER
Server:
- On the server side, it should first be checked if the number is correct
arguments that the user passes through a terminal at runtime.
- Server side buffer size should be 300 characters
- When setting the server address, you need to convert it from
host byte order in network byte order. In addition, a wildcard should be used.
- The server listens for connection requests on port 54355.
- The maximum number of requests for establishing a connection should be 3.
- In case of failed connection acceptance to print an error message
"There was an error connecting the connection. Obidete se povtorno!‚Äù
- After successful execution of the program on the server to print a message "Ocekuvam
requirements for establishing a connection on the part of the client".
- The server receives the message from the client and prints it on the screen.
- If the content of the message is "end", in that case the connection is terminated and
the message "Kraj na sesija" is printed.
- If everything is in order, the message sent by the client is separated
(message is in OriginalenString/Podstring/DrugOriginalenString format). The server
it needs to determine if the string in the middle is a substring of the other two strings
(OriginalenString and DrugOriginalenString)
- If it is a substring of both strings, in that case it sends a message to the client
"Podstring2", if it is a substring only on OriginalenString sends a message
"PodstringOriginalen" and if it is a substring only the DrugOriginalenString sends
message "PodstringDrug"
- Communication between the client and the server takes place continuously by
first the client sends a message and then the server responds.

Requeriment for Client 

- On the client's side, it should first be checked whether the number is correct
arguments that the user passes through a terminal at runtime.
- After establishing a connection with the server, a message with content should be printed
"Successfully established connection with the server".
- The message that the client enters through the keyboard should be in the next one
format: OriginalenString/Podstring/DrugOriginalenString . If it consists only
from numbers to print a message to the client "Ve molime vnesete nova poraka"
- If everything is fine, the message is sent to the server.
